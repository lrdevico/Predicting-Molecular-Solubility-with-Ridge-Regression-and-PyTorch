# Predicting-Molecular-Solubility-with-Ridge-Regression-and-PyTorch
This repository contains my first machine learning project, developed as a hands-on introduction to building, training, and evaluating regression models using both scikit-learn and PyTorch.  The goal is to predict the aqueous solubility (logS) of chemical compounds based on four molecular descriptors.
